# Download and Install Google's repo utility

The above libs are managed by the repo utility. First we need to create
our work environment

....
$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo 
....

Edit ~/.bash_profile and uncomment lines 32, 33 and 34 to add ~/bin to
PATH

# Create the PSoC_5LP Test directory

....
$: mkdir -p ~/projects/P5LP/ComponentsTest
$: cd projects/P5LP/ComponentsTest
....


# Initialise the ComponentsTest directory

....
$: repo init -u https://github.com/noeldiviney/P5LP_CompTest_repo
....

# Download the P5LP Component Test demos

....
$: repo sync
....

once this has completed you should have P5LP Component Test Projects in
place
